In the following, let $g$ and $h$ be elements of group $G$ if unspecified, and let $e$ be the identity.
\epigraph{\textbb{Definition.} A group is a groupoid with a single object}{Joke}
\begin{problem}
    Write a careful proof that every group is the group of isomorphisms of a groupoid. In particular, every group is the group of automorphisms of some object in some category.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Take the categary $\mathfrak{C}$ with a single object $O$ and $\text{Hom}(O,O)=G$ with composition in $\text{Hom}(O,O)$ given by the operation in $G$. Check everything.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Consider the sets of numbers listed in \S1.1, and decide which are made into groups by conventional operations such as addition and multiplication.
    If the answer is no, can we modify the group by a bit (such as removing $0$) to make it under a group for that operation?
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Nani?
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Prove that $(gh)\inv=h\inv g\inv$.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Because $(gh)\inv\cdot h\inv g\inv=e$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Suppose $g^2=e$ for all $g$. Show that $G$ is abelian.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    $gh=g\inv h\inv=(hg)\inv=hg$.
\end{soln}
