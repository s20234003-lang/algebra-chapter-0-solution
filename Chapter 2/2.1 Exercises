In the following, let $G$ be a grouplet $g$ and $h$ be elements of group $G$ if unspecified, and let $e$ be the identity.
\epigraph{\textbb{Definition.} A group is a groupoid with a single object}{Joke}
\begin{problem}
    Write a careful proof that every group is the group of isomorphisms of a groupoid.
    In particular, every group is the group of automorphisms of some object in some category.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Take the categary $\mathfrak{C}$ with a single object $O$ and $\text{Hom}(O,O)=G$ with composition in $\text{Hom}(O,O)$ given by the operation in $G$. Check everything.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Consider the sets of numbers listed in \S1.1, and decide which are made into groups by conventional operations such as addition and multiplication.
    If the answer is no, can we modify the group by a bit (such as removing $0$) to make it under a group for that operation?
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Just for completeness, the sets are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \ii \varnothing
        \ii \NN
        \ii \ZZ
        \ii \QQ
        \ii \RR
        \ii \CC
    \end{enumerate}
    Corrosponding groups:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \ii \varnothing is not a group because groups need an identity.
        \ii \NN is not a group under addition or multiplication becuse there is no inverses
        \ii \ZZ is a group under addition, however it is not a group under multiplication as there is no identity.
        \ii \QQ is a group under addition. Remove $0$ to get a group under multiplication.
        \ii Same as \QQ.
        \ii Same as \QQ, \RR.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Prove that $(gh)\inv=h\inv g\inv$.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Because $(gh)\inv\cdot h\inv g\inv=e$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Suppose $g^2=e$ for all $g$. Show that $G$ is abelian.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    $gh=g\inv h\inv=(hg)\inv=hg$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Show that every row of the Cayley table contains all elements of group exactly once.
    Similarly, show that in every row of the Cayley table contains all elements of group exactly once.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    For any elements $g$, $h$ and $k$, $gh=gk$ iff $g\inv gh=g\inv gk$ iff $h=k$, so $x\hookrightarrow gx$ is injective, hence surjective and bijective.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
	Prove that there is only one possible Cayley Table for $G$ if $G$ has exactly $1$, $2$, or $3$ elements.
	Analyze the possible Cayley tables for groups with exactly $4$ elements, and show that there are two distinct tables,
	up to reordering the elements of G. Use these tables to prove that all groups with $\leq 4$ elements are commutative.
	(You are welcome to analyze groups with 5 elements using the same technique, but you will soon know enough about groups
	to be able to avoid such brute-force approaches.)
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
	\begin{itemize}
		\ii Identity must exist in a group, so if $|G|=1$, the only element in $G$ must be the identity, i.e. $G$ is the trivial group
		\ii Assume $|G|=2$. Then $G={e,a}$ with $e\neq a$. Consider $a\inv$ now. It must be $a$, for if $e=a\inv$,
			we have $a=a\circ e=a\circ a\inv=e$, contradiction.
		\ii Assume $|G|=3$. Then $G={e,a,b}$. COnsider $a\inv$ again. By the above argument, it is not the identity $e$.
			So hence $a^2=e$ or $a\circ b=e$
			\begin{claim*}
				$a\circ b=e$
			\end{claim*}
			\begin{proof}
				Assume on the contrary $a^2=e$.
				Then $b\circ a$ is not $a^2=e$, nor $e\circ a=a$, nor $b\circ e=b$ by the previous problem, contradiction!
			\end{proof}
			So now the Cayley table would be like:
			\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c||c|c|c}
				$\circ$ & $e$ & $a$ & $b$\\\hline\hline
				$e$ & $e$ & $a$ & $b$\\\hline
				$a$ & $a$ & $b$ & $e$\\\hline
				$b$ & $b$ & $e$ & $a$
			\end{tabular}\end{center}
	\ii Assume $|G|=4$. If there exists an element $a$ with order $4$, then $G={1,a,a^2,a^3}$, so one group up to isomorphism. 
		Otherwise, take an element $g\neq e$. The order of $g$ is $2$ or $3$.
		If the order of $g$ is $3$, let $G={e,g,g^2,x}$, contradiction by considering $x\circ g$.
	\ii If $\G|=5$, I would just apply langrange's theorem, discussed later. It's too difficult without it
	\end{itemize}
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
	Let $g$ be of finite order. Then $g^N=e$ iff $\lvert g\rvert\mid N$
\end[problem}
\begin{soln}
	Let $N=d\lvert g\rvert +r$, where $0\leq r\le \lvert g\rvert$. Then $g^N=e$ iff $g^r=e$ iff $r=0$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
	Let $G$ be a finite abelian group with exactly one element $f$ with order $2$. Show that $\prod_{g\in G}g=f$.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
	The problem is equivalent to $\prod\limits_{\substack{\lvert g\rvert\geq 3\\ g\in G}}g=e$.
	Using an argument similar to Wilson, $\prod\limits_{\substack{\lvert g\rvert\geq 3\\ g\in G}}g=e$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
	Let $n=\lvert G\rvert$, $m$ be the number of elements that have order $2$. Show that $n-m$ is odd.
	In particular, if $n$ is even, show that there exists an element with order $2$.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
	Using the same argument as the above, pair $g$ with $g\inv$ if the order of $g$ is $\geq 3$.
	The second part follows.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
	Suppose the order of $g$ is odd. What can we say about $g^2$?
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
	I claim that $\left\lvert g^2\right\rvert=\lvert g\rvert$. Indeed assume $g^{2k-1}=e$ where $\lvert g\rvert=2k-1$.
	Then $(g^2)^\ell=e$ iff $g^{2\ell}=e$ implies $(2\ell=2k-1$ or $\ell\geq 2k-1)$ iff $\ell\geq 2k-1$.
	Now $(g^2)^{2k-1}=e$, done.
\end{soln}
\begin{remark}
	In fact if $|g|=n$, $\left\lvert g^2\right\rvert=\frac{3-(-1)^n}{4}n$
\end{remark}
