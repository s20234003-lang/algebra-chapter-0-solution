In the following, let $G$ be a grouplet $g$ and $h$ be elements of group $G$ if unspecified, and let $e$ be the identity.
\epigraph{\textbb{Definition.} A group is a groupoid with a single object}{Joke}
\begin{problem}
    Write a careful proof that every group is the group of isomorphisms of a groupoid.
    In particular, every group is the group of automorphisms of some object in some category.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Take the categary $\mathfrak{C}$ with a single object $O$ and $\text{Hom}(O,O)=G$ with composition in $\text{Hom}(O,O)$ given by the operation in $G$. Check everything.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Consider the sets of numbers listed in \S1.1, and decide which are made into groups by conventional operations such as addition and multiplication.
    If the answer is no, can we modify the group by a bit (such as removing $0$) to make it under a group for that operation?
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Just for completeness, the sets are:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \ii \varnothing
        \ii \NN
        \ii \ZZ
        \ii \QQ
        \ii \RR
        \ii \CC
    \end{enumerate}
    Corrosponding groups:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \ii \varnothing is not a group because groups need an identity.
        \ii \NN is not a group under addition or multiplication becuse there is no inverses
        \ii \ZZ is a group under addition, however it is not a group under multiplication as there is no identity.
        \ii \QQ is a group under addition. Remove $0$ to get a group under multiplication.
        \ii Same as \QQ.
        \ii Same as \QQ, \RR.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Prove that $(gh)\inv=h\inv g\inv$.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    Because $(gh)\inv\cdot h\inv g\inv=e$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Suppose $g^2=e$ for all $g$. Show that $G$ is abelian.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    $gh=g\inv h\inv=(hg)\inv=hg$.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
    Show that every row of the Cayley table contains all elements of group exactly once.
    Similarly, show that in every row of the Cayley table contains all elements of group exactly once.
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
    For any elements $g$, $h$ and $k$, $gh=gk$ iff $g\inv gh=g\inv gk$ iff $h=k$, so $x\hookrightarrow gx$ is injective, hence surjective and bijective.
\end{soln}
\begin{problem}
	Prove that there is only one possible Cayley Table for $G$ if $G$ has exactly $1$, $2$, or $3$ elements.
	Analyze the possible multiplication tables for groups with exactly $4$ elements, and show that there are two distinct tables,
	up to reordering the elements of G. Use these tables to prove that all groups with $\leq 4$ elements are commutative.
	(You are welcome to analyze groups with 5 elements using the same technique, but you will soon know enough about groups
	to be able to avoid such brute-force approaches.)
\end{problem}
\begin{soln}
	\begin{itemize}
		\ii Identity must exist in a group, so if $|G|=1$, the only element in $G$ must be the identity, i.e. $G$ is the trivial group
		\ii Assume $|G|=2$. Then $G={e,a}$ with $e\neq a$. Consider $a\inv$ now. It must be $a$, for if $e=a\inv$,
			we have $a=a\circ e=a\circ a\inv=e$, contradiction.
		\ii Assume $|G|=3$. Then $G={e,a,b}$. COnsider $a\inv$ again. By the above argument, it is not the identity $e$.
			So hence $a^2=e$ or $a\circ b=e$
			\begin{claim*}
				$a\circ b=e$
			\end{claim*}
			\begin{proof}
				Assume on the contrary $a\circ b$
			\end{proof}
	\end{itemize}
\end{soln}
